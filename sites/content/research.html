<p> My primary research characterizes how the gut microbiome modifies environmental exposures to influence human health. I have over a decade of experience integrating biochemical, immunological, cellular, and computational techniques to examine molecular interactions between microbes and their hosts. This experience includes extensive specific training in mucosal immunology and microbial bioinformatics. As a graduate student, I defined molecular mechanisms through which HIV infection disrupts the gut innate immune system and its response to commensal microbes. As a postdoc, I devised computational approaches to manage, analyze, and integrate massive volumes of diverse data, including 16S, shotgun metagenomic, and transcriptomic sequence data. I have applied these approaches to define how environmental exposure impacts the operation of the gut microbiome and the hostâ€™s physiology. I collaborate extensively in my research; as a postdoc I have led five productive, multidisciplinary collaborations with investigators from environmental toxicology, nutrition, microbiology, immunology, soil science, statistics, and computer science. These collaborations have resulted in highly cited publications in reputable journals and produced preliminary data that subsequently yielded federal funding support. </p>
