Dr. Christopher Gaulke is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Oregon State University. Dr. Gaulke has over a decade of experience integrating diverse data to uncover molecular mechanisms underpinning host-microbe interactions. He earned his Bachelor of Science from Central Washington University and went on to complete his PhD with Dr. Satya Dandekar at the University of California, Davis.  His dissertation characterized the molecular mechanisms through which HIV infection disrupts the gut innate immune system and its response to commensal microbes. Dr. Gaulke subsequently accepted a postdoctoral position at Oregon State University (OSU) working with Dr. Thomas Sharpton. Dr. Gaulke’s postdoctoral research focused on understanding how the microbiome mediates interactions between the vertebrates and their environment. At OSU he has developed the zebrafish as a high-throughput screening tool to identify environmental factors that define microbiome operation and devised computational approaches to manage, analyze, and integrate massive volumes of multi’omics sequence data. Alongside his twenty-two manuscripts published or in review at reputable journals, Dr. Gaulke initiated an experiential research program in microbial genomics for undergraduates, developed and taught a graduate course, and contributed to the mentorship and training of over twenty students.
